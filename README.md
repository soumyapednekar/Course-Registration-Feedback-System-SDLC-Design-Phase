# Course-Registration-Feedback-System-SDLC-Design-Phase

**Project Overview:**

The primary goal of this project was to enhance the course registration process by integrating a robust feedback mechanism. This mechanism allows students to make informed decisions based on the experiences of their peers, thus improving overall satisfaction and engagement in the learning journey. The project was sponsored by the UMBC Registrar Office and the Office for Academic and Pre-Professional Advising, emphasizing transparency, accountability, and continuous improvement in the academic environment.

 In the planning, analysis, and design phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). My role involved translating gathered requirements into detailed technical specifications and creating comprehensive design documents. Below is an outline of the SDLC phases and my contributions to each.

**Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Phases and Contributions:**

1. **Planning:**
   - **Team Contributions:**
     - Defined the project scope and objectives, focusing on improving the course registration experience by incorporating student feedback.
     - Identified stakeholders, including students, instructors, and administrative staff.
     - Developed a project plan, scheduling bi-weekly team meetings using Google Meet.
   - **My Contributions:**
     - Collaborated in brainstorming sessions to finalize project goals and deliverables.
     - Contributed to the development of the project timeline and resource allocation plans.

2. **Analysis:**
   - **Team Contributions:**
     - Conducted a thorough analysis of the existing registration process and identified the lack of feedback channels as a critical issue.
     - Developed detailed business requirements and use cases, including feedback submission, feedback viewing, and instructor access to feedback.
   - **My Contributions:**
     - Played a key role in defining technical requirements and creating use case diagrams and data flow diagrams (DFDs) to visualize the system.
     - Assisted in the analysis of potential risks and constraints, such as subjectivity and bias in feedback.

3. **Design:**
   - **Team Contributions:**
     - Created the logical and physical process models, including level 0 DFDs and interface structure diagrams.
     - Designed user interface prototypes ensuring seamless integration with the existing registration system.
   - **My Contributions:**
     - Designed the system architecture, focusing on database integration and user interface.
     - Ensured the design adhered to security standards and supported scalability.
     - Developed interface design prototypes and established interface conventions and standards for consistent user experience.

**Summary:**

Through meticulous planning, thorough analysis, and detailed design, we laid a strong foundation for a feedback mechanism that would significantly improve the course registration process. My role as the Lead Developer was pivotal in ensuring that our design met the project goals and was ready for implementation. This project, though not involving actual coding, provided invaluable experience in the early phases of the SDLC, emphasizing the importance of thorough preparation and detailed design in successful system development.
